Multi User Blog Project

Author: Vince

Live demo on https://ferrous-purpose-159412.appspot.com/

I have used Google App Engine to set up this project. If you want to run the code, please first get Google App Engine SDK for Python:

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads

Test the application using the local development server (dev_appserver.py), which is included with the SDK.

From within the Multi-User-Blog directory, start the local development server with the following command:

dev_appserver.py app.yaml

The local development server is now running and listening for requests on port 8080.

Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser to view the app.
